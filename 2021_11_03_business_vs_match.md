## The worlds is Â loosely coupled

 'Business programming in a large'  is orthogonal to the mathematic structures.  I.e., in the naive view,  deep mathematical abstractions should lead to beautiful small easy-maintainable programs.  In practice,  it's not: software systems in condensed abstracted style are often hard to support because of strong coupling.  Math is like a crystal -- it has a stable structure that formed around the main idea.  Business is like a natural object, a river or tree -- its structure formed by different thoughts, which often contradict each other.  
  We can think about metrics here -- the rate changes should be commensurate with the cost of ongoing refactoring.
